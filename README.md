# Test-Suite
Bash Script that takes any program, its standard input, and expected output and displays any deviation the program has from expected output.

To Use: 
1. Download the Test Suite script File
2. In your program respository, create your test files in the format "test1.in" for your programs input, and "test1.out" for _expected_ output, as well as "test1.args" if applicable. 
3. Compile all your test stem names into a .txt file, one on each line. ie. (test1\n test2\n test3\n ...). 
4. Run the Test Suite script with your test file and program as command line arguments. 
5. The program will output any tests that failed, and their respective actual and expected output.
